# ViaRE's Reference

This is the place in where we share the list of references we use to keep developing
[ViaRE](https://github.com/daque-dev/viare).

## Content
- [The proccess](#the-proccess) (how to add more references to this repo)

## The proccess

Every reference we find must go through this proccess:

- **The Finding**: We find a book, website, article, magazine, etc. that we consider
may be useful to keep generating ideas, getting context, or keeping us interested.
When we skim the table of contents or something similar, we should take note of what
the book could give to ViaRe, and then the book makes it to the `finding list`.

- **Note-taking**: When any member or contributor of [Daque](https://github.com/orgs/daque-dev/people)
starts to read an item inside `finding list`, they must start to take notes on that
item. If a file of notes on that item already exists, it should add the notes under
a subtitle with their name.

- **Referencing notes**: Every file with notes must be referenced from this file, under
the category (or categories) it fits better in. If no category seems appropiate, it
should be discussed in a new issue. A brief paragraph must accompany the entry, and
must describe the most general contribution to this knowledge-base.

- **Abstraction and Description**: Trying to abstract the new acquired knowledge and
describe it mathematically, getting it ready to the last step.

- **Implementation**: Reflected in a new repository, meant to explore the idea and do
a lot of experiments, updating our mathematical description until we feel is ready to
be included in ViaRE's main repository.
